HMAC stands for Hash-based Message Authentication Code. It is a type of cryptographic algorithm that combines a cryptographic hash function with a secret key to produce a message authentication code.

**The purpose of HMAC is to verify the integrity and authenticity of a message**, ensuring that it has not been modified or tampered with during transmission. It provides a way to detect unauthorized changes or tampering with the data.

The HMAC algorithm operates as follows:

1.  Input: The original message and a secret key are provided as inputs to the HMAC algorithm.
    
2.  Key Padding: If necessary, the secret key is padded to match the block size of the underlying hash function being used.
    
3.  Inner Hash: The padded key is XORed with a specific value (usually a constant) and then concatenated with the original message. This concatenated data is then hashed using the chosen hash function.
    
4.  Outer Hash: The resulting hash value from the previous step is XORed with the padded key, concatenated with the previous result, and hashed again using the same hash function.
    
5.  Output: The final hash value obtained from the second hashing step is the HMAC.
    

To verify the integrity and authenticity of the message, the recipient of the message performs the same HMAC computation using the shared secret key. If the computed HMAC matches the received HMAC, it indicates that the message has not been modified during transmission and the sender possesses the correct secret key.

HMAC provides a secure and efficient way to authenticate messages, ensuring data integrity and protecting against unauthorized modifications or tampering. It is widely used in various protocols and applications, including secure communication protocols (e.g., TLS/SSL), message authentication codes (MACs), and authentication mechanisms for APIs and web services.
