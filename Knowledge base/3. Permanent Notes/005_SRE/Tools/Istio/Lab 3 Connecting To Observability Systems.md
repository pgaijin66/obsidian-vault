One of the most powerful parts of Istio is its ability to use the mesh to quickly troubleshoot and diagnose issues that inevitably come up in microservices networking. Where are requests slowing down? Where are they failing? Where are things becoming overloaded? Having something like Envoy proxy in the request path on both sides of a transport between services acts like a flood light to help uncover these issues.

Note: If you open the Prometheus/Grafana/Kiali UI tab, you will see the "Please wait, we are trying to connect to the service..." message. This is normal before these services are installed.

We saw in Lab 01 that Envoy surfaces a large set of stats, metrics, gauges, and histograms. In this lab we look at connecting that source of information to an observability system. In many ways the mesh makes these systems more valuable. Istio comes with a few sample addons for adding observability components like Prometheus, Grafana, and Kiali. In this lab we assume you are not going to use these components in production. They are intended for very simple deployments and not intended for a realistic production setup. We will install something that looks more realistic and use that. It is important to note that Istio's sample addons for Prometheus, Grafana, Kiali, etc are NOT intended for production usage. This guide will walk through a more production-like setup.

## Prerequisites

We will be using a realistic observability system that uses Prometheus and many other components out of the box called kube-prometheus. This project tries to curate and pre-integrate a realistic deployment, highly available deployment of Prometheus with the Prometheus operator, Grafana, and a lot of ancillary pieces like alertmanager, node-exporters, adapters for the Kube API, and others. Please see the kube-prometheus docs for more.

Adding services to the mesh requires that the client-side proxies be associated with the service components and registered with the control plane. With Istio, you have two methods to inject the Envoy Proxy sidecar into the microservice Kubernetes pods:

We will be using the helm charts to install kube-prometheus. Just note, for this lab we will slightly trim down the number of components installed to stay within some of our VM resource limits (specifically for the instructor-led labs, though on your own cluster, carry on :) ).

## Install kube-prometheus and highly-available Prometheus

To get started, let's create the namespace into which we'll deploy our observability components:

`kubectl create ns prometheus`

Next, let's add the prometheus community chart repo and then update available helm charts locally.

`helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts helm repo update`

Next, let's run the helm installer.

`helm install prom prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack \   --set grafana.defaultDashboardsEnabled=false \   --set 'grafana.grafana\.ini.auth\.anonymous.enabled'=true \   --version ${PROMETHEUS_HELM_VERSION} \   -n prometheus`

This command may take a few moments to complete; be patient.

At this point, we should have a successfully installed prometheus. To verify the components that were installed to support observability for us, let's check the pods:

`kubectl get po -n prometheus`

`NAME                                                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE prom-grafana-5ff645dfcc-qp57d                          2/2     Running   0          21s prom-kube-prometheus-stack-operator-5498b9f476-j6hjc   1/1     Running   0          21s prom-kube-state-metrics-5f8c8f78bc-hf5m6               1/1     Running   0          21s prom-prometheus-node-exporter-7rs7d                    1/1     Running   0          21s prometheus-prom-kube-prometheus-stack-prometheus-0     2/2     Running   1          17s`

Now move over to terminal 2. Let's quickly port-forward the Prometheus deployment and verify we can connect to it:

`kubectl -n prometheus port-forward statefulset/prometheus-prom-kube-prometheus-stack-prometheus 9090 --address 0.0.0.0`

Now verify it works by going to the Prometheus dashboard by clicking its tab:

![Prometheus Graph](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solo-io/workshops/master/istio-day2/1-deploy-istio/images/prom-graph.png)

Press ctrl+C on terminal 2 to end the port forwarding and let's try the same thing for the Grafana dashboard:

`kubectl -n prometheus port-forward svc/prom-grafana 3000:80 --address 0.0.0.0`

Now go to the Grafana tab to verify you can get to the Grafana dashboard.

Now you should see the main dashboard like this:

![Grafana Dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solo-io/workshops/master/istio-day2/1-deploy-istio/images/grafana-main.png)

Feel free to poke around and see what dashboards are available with this default set up. Note that if you're unfamiliar with Grafana, you should start by clicking the "Home" button on the top left of the main screen

Press crtl+C on terminal 2 when you are done

## Add Istio Dashboards to Grafana

There are out of the box Grafana dashboards that Istio includes with its sample version of the Grafana installation. As mentioned earlier in the lab, this is intended for demonstration purposes only and not for production.

As we've installed Grafana in a more realistic scenario, we should figure out how to get the Istio Grafana dashboards into our deployment of Grafana. The first step is to get the dashboards from the Istio source repo located hereÂ [https://grafana.com/orgs/istio](https://grafana.com/orgs/istio).

To get them to work with our-installed Grafana, we need to import them as configmaps. Run the following, kinda-long, command to do this in either terminal:

`kubectl -n prometheus create cm istio-dashboards \ --from-file=istio-control-plane-dashboard.json=labs/03/dashboards/istio-control-plane-dashboard.json \ --from-file=istio-workload-dashboard.json=labs/03/dashboards/istio-workload-dashboard.json \ --from-file=istio-service-dashboard.json=labs/03/dashboards/istio-service-dashboard.json \ --from-file=istio-mesh-dashboard.json=labs/03/dashboards/istio-mesh-dashboard.json \ --from-file=istio-performance-dashboard.json=labs/03/dashboards/istio-performance-dashboard.json`

Lastly, we need to label this configmap so that our Grafana picks it up:

`kubectl label -n prometheus cm istio-dashboards grafana_dashboard=1`

If we port-forward our Grafana dashboard again, we can go find our new Istio dashboards:

`kubectl -n prometheus port-forward svc/prom-grafana 3000:80 --address 0.0.0.0`

Click on the Grafana tab with admin/prom-operator and on the main screen click the "Home" link on the top left part of the dashboard:

![Grafana Home button](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solo-io/workshops/master/istio-day2/1-deploy-istio/images/grafana-click-home.png)

From here, you should see the new Istio dashboards that have been added under 'General', but note that it may take a few moments for the dashboards to appear.

![Grafana Home Menu](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solo-io/workshops/master/istio-day2/1-deploy-istio/images/grafana-istio-dashboard-list.png)

Click the "Istio Control Plane" dashboard. You should be taken to a dashboard with some interesting graphs.

![Grafana Graphs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solo-io/workshops/master/istio-day2/1-deploy-istio/images/grafana-empty-cp-dashboard.png)

Actually, the graphs are all empty!! This is not of much value to us, so let's figure out how to populate these graphs. It may take quite a few minutes for data to populate into the Grafana dashboards. In practice, it may be worth moving on to other parts and coming back later to check the data in the dashboards.

## Scraping the Istio service mesh: control plane

The reason we don't see any information in the Control Plane dashboard (or any of the Istio dashboards really) is because we don't have any configuration for scraping information from the Istio service mesh. To configure Prometheus to do this, we will use the Prometheus Operator CRs ServiceMonitor and PodMonitor. These Custom Resources are described in good detail in the design doc on the Prometheus Operator repo.

You can leave the port fowarding on in terminal 2 but move over to terminal 1. Here's how we can set up a ServiceMonitor to scrape the Istio control-plane components:

`cat labs/03/monitor-control-plane.yaml`


---
```
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: ServiceMonitor
metadata:
  name: istio-component-monitor
  namespace: prometheus
  labels:
    monitoring: istio-components
    release: prom
spec:
  jobLabel: istio
  targetLabels: [app]
  selector:
    matchExpressions:
    - {key: istio, operator: In, values: [pilot]}
  namespaceSelector:
    any: true
  endpoints:
  - port: http-monitoring
    interval: 15s
```

`apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1 kind: ServiceMonitor metadata:   name: istio-component-monitor   namespace: prometheus  labels:     monitoring: istio-components     release: prom spec:   jobLabel: istio  targetLabels: [app]   selector:     matchExpressions:     - {key: istio, operator: In, values: [pilot]}   namespaceSelector:     any: true   endpoints:   - port: http-monitoring     interval: 15s`

Let's apply it:

`kubectl apply -f labs/03/monitor-control-plane.yaml`

At this point we will start to see important telemetry signals about the control plane such as the number of sidecars attached to the control plane, whether there are configuration conflicts, the amount of churn in the mesh, as well as basic memory/CPU usage of the control plane. As mentioned earlier, it may take a few minutes for these signals to start to make it into the Grafana dashboards, so be patient. Since there aren't very many workloads (just our httpbin service we installed for testing), we won't see too much data.

## Scraping the Istio service mesh: data plane

If we go check a different dashboard like "Istio Service Dashboard", we will see it's empty as there aren't any rules set up to scrape the data plane yet.

Just like we did in the previous section, we need to enable scraping for the data plane. To do that, we'll use a PodMonitor that looks like this:

`cat labs/03/monitor-data-plane.yaml`

`apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1 kind: PodMonitor metadata:   name: envoy-stats-monitor   namespace: prometheus  labels:     monitoring: istio-proxies     release: prom spec:   selector:     matchExpressions:     - {key: istio-prometheus-ignore, operator: DoesNotExist}   namespaceSelector:     any: true   jobLabel: envoy-stats   podMetricsEndpoints:   - path: /stats/prometheus    interval: 15s    relabelings:     - action: keep      sourceLabels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_container_name]       regex: "istio-proxy"     - action: keep      sourceLabels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_annotationpresent_prometheus_io_scrape]     - sourceLabels: [__address__, __meta_kubernetes_pod_annotation_prometheus_io_port]       action: replace      regex: ([^:]+)(?::\d+)?;(\d+)       replacement: $1:$2       targetLabel: __address__    - action: labeldrop      regex: "__meta_kubernetes_pod_label_(.+)"     - sourceLabels: [__meta_kubernetes_namespace]       action: replace      targetLabel: namespace    - sourceLabels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_name]       action: replace      targetLabel: pod_name`

Let's create it:

`kubectl apply -f labs/03/monitor-data-plane.yaml`

Let's also generate some load to the data plane (by calling our httpbin service) so telemetry will show up:

`for i in {1..10}; do kubectl exec deploy/sleep -n default -- curl http://httpbin.default:8000/headers; done`

Now we should be scraping the data-plane workloads. If we check Grafana under the Istio Service Dashboard, specifically the "Service Workload" section, we should start to see load after a bit of time.

![Grafana Service Dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solo-io/workshops/master/istio-day2/1-deploy-istio/images/grafana-service-workloads.png)

If we go back and look at the Control Plane dashboard, we should see those XDS graphs now populated:

![Populated Grafana Control Pane](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solo-io/workshops/master/istio-day2/1-deploy-istio/images/grafana-xds.png)

Press ctl+C on terminal 2 and then go back to terminal 1 for the next section

NOTE: If you do not see any metrics, wait a few min and check again. Prometheus is sometimes slow to capure data.

## Installing Kiali

Kiali is a networking graph dashboard that shows connectivity paths between services. This is different than a Grafana graph that shows line charts, bar graphs, etc. Kiali gives a visual representation of the services and how the connect to each other.

Again, Istio ships with a sample version of Kiali out of the box but for realistic deployments, the Istio and Kiali teams recommend using the Kiali Operator.

Let's install the kiali-operator here:

`kubectl create ns kiali-operator helm install \ --set cr.create=true \ --set cr.namespace=istio-system \ --namespace kiali-operator \ --repo https://kiali.org/helm-charts \ --version ${KIALI_HELM_VERSION} \ kiali-operator \ kiali-operator`

You may see helm complain about some parts of the Kiali install; you can ignore those for now and verify the Kiali Operator got installed correctly

At this point we have the Kiali operator installed. Let's check that it's up and running:

`kubectl get po -n kiali-operator`

`NAME                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE kiali-operator-67f4977465-rq2b8   1/1     Running   0          42s`

Now that the operator is installed, we need to declare an instance of Kiali to install and run. We will do that with the Kiali CR:

`cat labs/03/kiali-no-auth.yaml`



`apiVersion: kiali.io/v1alpha1 kind: Kiali metadata:   namespace: istio-system   name: kiali spec:   istio_namespace: "istio-system"   istio_component_namespaces:     prometheus: prometheus  auth:     strategy: anonymous  deployment:     accessible_namespaces:     - '**'   external_services:     prometheus:       cache_duration: 10       cache_enabled: true       cache_expiration: 300       url: "http://prom-kube-prometheus-stack-prometheus.prometheus:9090"     istio:       config_map_name: istio-${ISTIO_REVISION}       istiod_deployment_name: istiod-${ISTIO_REVISION}       istio_sidecar_injector_config_map_name: istio-sidecar-injector-${ISTIO_REVISION}`

Kiali leverages the telemetry signals that Prometheus scrapes from the Istio control plane and data plane. In the previous sections we installed Prometheus, but for Kiali, we need to configure it to use our specific Prometheus. In the configuration above you should see we configure Kiali to use Prometheus atÂ [http://prom-kube-prometheus-stack-prometheus.prometheus:9090](http://prom-kube-prometheus-stack-prometheus.prometheus:9090/). You may be wondering how to secure the connection between Kiali and Prometheus? Actually Prometheus doesn't come with any out of the box security strategies. They recommend running a reverse proxy (Envoy?!) in front of it. From Kiali we can use TLS and basic auth to connect to Prometheus.

Let's create the Kiali instance:

`cat labs/03/kiali-no-auth.yaml | envsubst | kubectl apply -f -`

Note, you may see kubectl complain about the manner in which we apply this resource; you can safely ignore it for this lab.

Let's check that it got created:

`kubectl get po -n istio-system`

`NAME                            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE istiod-1-14-78b88c997d-rpnck    1/1     Running   0          39h kiali-67cd5cf9fc-lnwc9          1/1     Running   0          29s`

Now back in terminal 2 let's port-forward the Kiali dashboard:

`kubectl -n istio-system port-forward deploy/kiali 20001 --address 0.0.0.0`

![Kiali Dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solo-io/workshops/master/istio-day2/1-deploy-istio/images/kiali-dashboard.png)

Congrats! You've installed the Kiali dashboard and connected it to the Prometheus instance collecting Istio telemetry. In the next few labs, we'll introduce our services to the mesh and send traffic through them. We should see Kiali populated with information at that point.

### Recap

In this lab we've set up one of the most important parts of running a service mesh: the observability systems around it. At this point you should have a good understanding of the Istio data plane, have the control plane installed, and now have a realistic observability system.

## Next lab

In the next lab, we will leverage Istio's ingress gateway to secure an edge service and share some tips on how to configure and debug the gateway.
