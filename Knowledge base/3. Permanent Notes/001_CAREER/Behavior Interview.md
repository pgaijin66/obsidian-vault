**Tell me about yourself.**
First of all, thank you for taking the time to give me a call. I appreciate it. 

please feel free to interrupt me if you need any clarification on anything I said or want to follow up on a specific topic.I generally tend to get passionate and start rambling :D 

So, My name is Prabesh Thapa. Born and Raised in Nepal ( Land of Mt Everest). I recently moved to the US to be with my partner. 

Currently, I am working as an SRE for a Nonprofit company called Chhaano.  where I am responsible for "leading a team of 5+ developers" and overseeing projects from "design to delivery" . 

while maintaining the security and reliability of the systems.

Before this, I worked as a Site Reliability Engineer at Audinate. 

One of the major projects I did at migrating organization workload from docker swarm to Kubernetes 

which involved researching and implementing the solution for production infra, upskilling and training engineering teams to use Kubernetes, and 

also setup infra as such it is fully reproducible using infra as code using tools like terraform and Ansible.

I did a lot of SRE business-as-usual work like 

developing internal automation toolings, capacity planning, implementing monitoring and observability across networks and systems, 

communication, and collaboration with other teams and stakeholders, 

and driving networking reliability efforts.

Academically, I did my master's in computer networking from Melbourne Institute of Tech Australia (MIT). 

My colleagues generally tend to describe me as a curious and passionate person. and I think that is kind of true to some extent hahaha

Clarity and clear communication are paramount for me and I subscribe to them in my personal and professional life.

I believe in continuous improvement and to do that i love to make tech videos, read books, and follow the latest tech trends to keep up with the innovations happening around me. 

I also do pocket-sized mini-projects to experiment with things I learned and get quick feedback from others to cement the knowledge and improve upon it.

If possible add mentoring

Finally, I am a dog dad to a sweet CavaPoo ( MoMo )

I think that summarizes myself and highlights some of my experiences. so yeah that's about it.

During a recent project, I was responsible for helping to improve the margins of an existing product line used by multiple customer segments. The product had multiple elements of design, manufacturing, and software support. Leadership had been eyeing cost-cutting efforts for some time. My first step was to clearly understand the situation and how the product had become less profitable. So, I sat down with the design, sales, marketing, and operations teams to document all perspectives. In parallel, I met with the finance team to clearly understand areas of potential savings. In the end, I identified 3 clear steps: streamline processes around assembly and testing, make small design tweaks to remove unnecessary features, and simplify the product overall. Making this proposal required talking to each team individually, armed with financial data that could convince them that this effort was worthwhile. The data had to make sense and projections needed to be realistic. I also needed to leverage my technical background to understand nuances in the design and assembly. Ultimately, the effort saved the company more than $5M over the next two years, and helped set the precedent for efficient and lean product development. Why this answer worked well:The answer set the stage and detailed each action step.The candidate’s approach showed a holistic view of the challenge and deep understanding of the business.Leadership skills were proven by significant, quantifiable results.

**How do you deal with opinionated co-workers?**

- 


**What is your greatest strength?**
- Curiosity and innovation
- As an example, the problem ( JIRA issue triaging ), using OpenAI and ChatGPT triage JIRA issue quicker
- Mention a recent project. 

**What is your greatest weakness?**
- Rabbit hole

I get excited when people on my team brainstorm about big new ideas. I sometimes get so caught up in the moment that I volunteer to do too much. I know this can be a distraction in ways that put me at risk of not getting work done properly or missing deadlines. I've been reflecting on why this happens. As I've become more conscious of this pattern, I'm working on ways to contain the negative aspects of my eagerness. One way that I do this is to still go to brainstorming meetings but to be more careful about offering to do the next steps—or limit it to one project that my boss supports. Fortunately, though, the job we're discussing seems well-suited for people like me, people that bring a lot of enthusiasm to the job and are ready to keep getting better and better at the follow-through. Why this answer worked well:He shared a story about how a weakness would negatively impact his work and stress him out.He turned his self-awareness into a plan to help him manage that weakness so he would be 
successful in the future.He shared specific details, which made the story feel relatable.

I think my coworkers would tell you that I'm the one you turn to when it's time to make sure everyone stays motivated and on track to pull off big, high-profile projects. In one of my LinkedIn recommendations, my supervisor refers to me as the “Human Glue”, which is something I'm proud of. She gave me that nickname after we went through a complex ERP implementation. It was one of those stressful time-critical projects that required the team to come together and make things happen in a short amount of time. I kept the crew going, sometimes through long evening and weekend hours, and inspired them to bring their absolute best to the project everyday. I think that they also appreciated the pizza and donuts I brought in too. Why this answer worked well:He shared something specifically related to the job.He pointed the interviewer to a supervisor's favorable LinkedIn recommendation.He shared a bit of humor.

**Why did you leave your current role**
- Relocation

 **Describe your most challenging project.**
- ad8 kubernetes migration
- up

In my current role, I was in charge of leading a major marketing campaign for a new product launching nationwide. The project was challenging both because of how large it was and because it involved constant communication with at least seven teams inside my company. Even though I tried to share the same information with everyone, it was clear that not everyone was on the same page. Partway through, I discovered that some of the teams were not on schedule with their assigned tasks. The implications were significant, and a delay to the campaign would negatively impact our revenue goals. I identified the root causes of the delays and set up a plan of action to address them. I planned in-depth one-on-one meetings with the team leaders to help re-inspire them. We talked about the goals and set ambitious targets for getting these last items across the finish line. I then organized and led status-update calls for the larger team and implemented a public dashboard to keep everyone accountable. In the end, we did meet the marketing campaign deadlines and the product launch was a hit. The company hit their revenue goals and everyone on the sales team received a well-deserved bonus. Why this answer worked well:She told us about the potential for serious negative consequences.She described concrete action steps she took to overcome this challenge.She shared the positive results of her actions.

- expected 195 k - 210k 
- My experience and years in field closely aligns with this role which i beileve which valueable to quicky start adding value to the company.
- With that said, my goal is to grow with the company.


Based on my current compensation and market research from resources like Glassdoor and levels.fyi, I am seeking a base salary within the range of $[dollar amount] to $[dollar amount]. I’ve seen similar roles that are offering $[dollar amount]. My specific experience and years in the field are closely aligned with this position, making me a strong candidate to be able to jump in and quickly add value. That said, I understand that this base salary range might be on the higher end of the spectrum for a growing company, and I’m willing to consider a lesser base paired with a signing bonus or increase in restricted stock units. My intention is to grow with the company and invest myself in its success. Why this answer worked well:The answer was well-researched and demonstrated the value that the candidate could add to the company.The candidate provided a base salary range, as well as alternative forms of compensation.

**What do you like to do outside work?**
- Cookings, painting, spending time with family,
- mini projects byte sized innovation and curiosity

I really love backpacking in different countries, especially with different cultures than the one I grew up in. I find that it allows me to disconnect and recharge from everyday life, while growing and learning something new. To date, I’ve backpacked either alone or with friends in over 20 countries, across Asia, South and Central America. For our honeymoon, my wife and I travelled northern India for 6 weeks. It’s a very diverse region, home to Hindus, Muslims, and Buddhists, and we really enjoyed spending time in a few different states. We did a diverse set of activities like hiking the Himalayas and Ladakh, finding cool hot springs, and Vipassana meditation. Vipassan is a 10 days of silence meditation. I’ve really connected with the technique and have found it to be a powerful way to focus my attention and reset myself. Why this answer worked well:The candidate showed interest in learning from people with different backgrounds.The answer included hobbies centered around health and self-improvement.

**Tell me about a time you had to learn something very quickly.**
- AWS learned and orchestrated
- Run daily AWS workshop

When I started in my role, I thought I was quite good at Excel. I had told my employer that I knew how to calculate complex formulas, but I quickly discovered that my experience was well behind that of my peers. I didn’t want my boss to know that I was trailing in my capabilities just as I stepped into the new role, so I came up with a plan to teach myself everything I was missing. Every day after work, I watched at least an hour of Khan Academy videos. I also found practice worksheets online that allowed me to test myself and be sure I was mastering the content. Within three weeks, I was nearly as fast and fluent as my colleagues at work, and my boss never knew I had come in behind. Why this answer worked well:She showed initiative by going above and beyond after work to catch up to her peers.She was specific in what she didn’t know and then told a clear and concise story about what she needed to do to change the situation.She described how with focus and hard work she was able to catch up rather quickly.

During my role as Manager of Transportation Procurement, I was tasked with creating reports for procurement and presenting them to our Business Intelligence department. I was selected for the project because of my engineering experience. After creating the reports, the BI team told me that they were backlogged for at least 6 months — which was an unacceptable timeline for my manager. I was hesitant to break protocol, but explained that I could actually design and implement the entire project myself within 6 weeks. To get it done, I logged extra hours each day of the week. I created a power template with all the SQL connection, necessary queries and joins, as well as all the DAX calculations needed. I replicated the template for each report needed and built a dashboard as a web interface for users to access the reports. When I shared this with my boss, I was asked to present it in an upcoming meeting. To my surprise, both the President and VP of the division attended. My hard work was very well received. The next week, I was given a promotion and assigned full responsibility for Business Intelligence. Why this answer worked well:The candidate showed a willingness to take on additional responsibilities to accommodate an aggressive timeline.The process and tools used to complete the project reflect deep experience and expertise.The candidate’s promotion provided proof of success and the ability to win the trust of leadership.



**Tell me about a time you had to handle pressure.**
- 

When I was working as a Systems Integration Manager, I was responsible for onboarding a client to our TMS (transportation management solution) on a tight timeline. This was challenging because the client managed their own transportation independently. None of their data or invoicing for freight was centralized, and I was missing a lot of information. We needed to hit our target go-live date because my company had already hired employees for the account and needed the revenue. I knew that I needed to get the info by the end of the week to ensure that I could validate assumptions used for RFP, margin, resource leveling, and so on. I set up a call with the client and they explained that they were short on manpower and would need more time. I offered to visit the sites, conduct the interviews, complete the site and freight profiles, and take all necessary photos. Once I gathered the information, my team keyed in the data and we hit our go-live date without a moment to spare. The project was a success. We hit our revenue numbers as planned, no money was lost, and all parties were very pleased. Thanks to the extra effort, our relationship with that client is stronger than ever. Why this answer worked well:The candidate showed leadership by going the extra mile to accomplish a goal for both the company and the client.Success was framed in a way that captured both the short-term impact to the project (meeting sales goals) and the long-term benefit to company growth (strengthening a business relationship).

**Tell me about a time you surpassed people's expectations.**
- 

As a young professional, I was given a small event to manage for my company's senior executives. We originally expected about 50 attendees, but then the CEO decided to participate too. Suddenly, the event became much bigger with 400 people attending. We had to organize buses, food, scripted content, speeches and the program itself. I stepped up and designed carefully crafted messaging documents for each stakeholder; had weekly check-ins with each group; and ran volunteer training sessions to be sure that all the logistics ran smoothly. I learned the importance of careful planning and constant practice; two habits that paid off on many projects since then. The event is now considered the most successful of our division. My boss praised my work for going far beyond what she expected when the project was first assigned. Why this answer worked well:She painted a picture of how she approached a new problem.She explained how she adjusted throughout to meet challenges as they arose.She described the successful outcome and its implications for her job.


**Tell me about a time you created a goal and achieved it.**
- 


I was two weeks into my first role with a new company when the leader of our business unit requested to showcase all the technology my team was working on, plus two brand new demos in the grand opening of our New York City office — in just six weeks. My manager tagged me to lead the charge. Most of our projects weren’t client-ready, which would mean lots of coding and testing to do in a short period of time. I don’t think anyone thought we’d have it 100% ready in time. I gathered the team and explained to them that we had a really cool opportunity, and asked for their ideas. I didn’t sugarcoat how hard it would be, but promised to do everything I could to clear the path. In the next few weeks, I quickly re-prioritized our Jira backlog to put other non-critical projects on pause and communicated to those stakeholders. I then implemented weekly sprints and daily standups to reduce meeting overhead and increase the time available for them to code and test in pairs. And to keep up morale, I requested funds from leadership to sponsor dinners for the team when they worked late, and even secured travel funds so that our developers could attend the opening. Through careful re-prioritization, open communication and keeping the morale high, we were able to successfully deliver the demo as the result. Why this answer worked well:The candidate was realistic about the challenge, but created a clear plan to meet the timeline.The candidate demonstrated leadership by encouraging morale and securing a team reward.


**Tell me about a time you disagreed with someone.**
- 

During my time on the growth strategy team, I partnered with various brand and finance teams to create a promotion and events calendar to maximize portfolio performance. This was especially challenging because each brand team was only responsible for their brand’s performance, while my job was to help ensure that the entire portfolio succeeded. This created an inherent discord in the exercise. In the past, teams would look back at the previous year’s events to essentially replicate them. It occurred to me that this may not be the most efficient way to plan the calendar, since the process didn’t involve any real evaluation of success. My partners were reluctant to let go of the existing process. To get buy-in, I prepared two scenarios. One used the old approach. The other used my new suggested approach with event evaluation criteria — showing both the monthly and total year sales estimate for each brand, as well as the entire portfolio. To make sure my case was airtight, I’d pre-worked with other cross-functional teams to ensure that the new projections were compatible with monthly product supply numbers and trade allowances. I was able to get buy-in and implement the new process, which has allowed us to factor in accurate estimates, measure success, and increase the efficiency of event planning. Why this answer worked well:The answer demonstrated the candidate’s ability to evaluate and optimize an existing process, using data and key performance metrics.The candidate showed flexibility in his approach through scenario planning, seeking a win-win solution for all partners.The outcome was a more strategic process and a net positive for the company.



**Tell me about a time you had to persuade someone.**
- 

At a key moment in my previous role, my team was trying to balance the growth of our user base and safety of users. We were exploring many solutions for this problem, and my role was to align the team. Our engineering manager had a strong perspective on a solution that was technically straightforward, but did not fully address both needs. Our designer wanted to implement a more complicated, but comprehensive solution. I believed that the latter seemed like the appropriate course of action, but it needed an additional layer of depth to fully address concerns from all parties. First, I partnered with the designer to outline the solution and create a framework that detailed key benefits and potential downsides. Next, I brought in an engineering counterpart to break down the costs and timing implications of building a comprehensive solution. These inputs enabled a strong case for the more complicated, but ultimately more meaningful solution. Enthusiastic team alignment made timely leadership buy-in possible. While I had to invest more detail work upfront, we were able to shave off a few weeks by broadening our technical brainstorms throughout the early stages — which allowed us to complete the project ahead of schedule Why this answer worked well:The candidate demonstrated the ability to identify project gaps and build a strong case towards the more optimal solution.The answer clearly outlined the approaches and strategies behind each action, which ultimately lead to improved efficiency and timely delivery.


**Tell me about a time you worked with a difficult person**
- people are not difficult
- different background and experience can lead to different perspective and opinion
- 

I don’t really believe that there are inherently difficult people. In my experience, different backgrounds and levels of information can make it difficult to understand another’s point of view. As a product manager, I really wanted to push for a shopping feature within our app. I saw a great opportunity to open a new potential revenue stream, but one of our key stakeholders — an engineering team lead — was concerned that we’d need to staff up in a significant way, and that the investment wouldn’t pay off. I did a little digging and spoke to his team members to understand his concerns better. I realized that I would need a quantitative analysis, rather than just a business plan. So I mapped out potential revenue to prove that this endeavor would not only be profitable in the short term, but over the next 5 years. He was impressed that I had run the same analytics as his engineering team would, which helped him move from a blocker to a strong advocate of the project. Why this answer worked well:The candidate showed a willingness to work through a difficult relationship by understanding another point of view.The approach was a blend of soft and technical skills, and the result was a clear win for the company.

**Tell me about a time you failed or made a mistake**
- 


While working in channel sales for a technology company that sold storage area network solutions, I made the mistake of announcing a new break/fix service that was not approved or rolled out internally yet. I had jumped the gun in assuming it was ready to go. As a result, over 50 global channel partners received the new program and some of them had already initiated quotes for end users. Once I realized my mistake, I sent out communication to the channel partners and owned up to it fully. Many reached out to me directly and were understandably confused and frustrated, but appreciated the transparency. I offered to speak to their customers and help with any quotes that may have been stuck. Ultimately, we were able to roll out the product fairly shortly thereafter, and there were no serious consequences. But I had learned my lesson. Since then, I’ve made more regular and effective communication a top priority. I make myself available and accessible to internal and external partners to keep a steady stream of information and updates flowing to avoid preventable errors. Why this answer worked well:The candidate showed that they are willing to hold themselves accountable and take direct action to solve problems.The answer outlined steps taken to avoid similar mistakes in the future, demonstrating a learning mentality.


**Describe your leadership style**
- 

I subscribe to McGregor’s Theory Y of management, which emphasizes the importance of "participation." This theory suggests that people take pride in their work and act responsibly for the most part. I firmly believe that everyone wants to do their level best, and will do so when they have a clear vision, the right tools, and a sense of ownership. This informs the way I lead and inspires my goal of creating a positive, inclusive, and enabling work environment for everyone involved. In my experience, this approach has kept collaborators highly motivated and delivering work in a way that is sustainable for everyone involved. While working on a small sales team, my focus was to set clear and collective targets to ensure ownership, and offer regular training sessions on selling process and technology use. This was more efficient than having a weekly check-in and feedback cadence. It was a refreshing change for the team who appreciated the autonomy. This approach was successful, as our team consistently delivered above plan revenue while achieving savings on trade allowances. I also received the CEO award for sales excellence and received the highest performance grading. Why this answer worked well:The answer includes their philosophy and a real-life example of how it has been successfully applied.The candidate’s story shows a genuine interest in teams and in building leadership skills.


**Where do you see yourself in 5 years?**
- 

My professional experience has provided a strong foundation and invaluable insight into my strengths, interests, and areas of opportunity. In the next 5 years, my aim is to continue to build strong relationships and trust by establishing myself as an expert in my field. This will require dedicated investment both in and outside of my role, gathering new perspectives from partners, colleagues, and mentors. I plan to spend the next 2-3 years honing my leadership skills. I’m a fast learner and enthusiastic student of the industry. In each role, I have sought mentorship, and would like to provide this kind of support to others in the future. I have enjoyed owning projects and leading collaborators, and believe that management is the next right path for me. That’s just one reason why I’m drawn to your company. I’ve heard incredible things about your management training programs, and I am looking for an organization I can grow with. I believe that I have both the drive and the soft skills to be a real asset to your team for years to come. Why this answer worked well:The candidate has a clear vision for their career and outlined how their goals can be an asset to the company.An interest in mentorship shows willingness to take guidance, as well as invest energy in others.




**Do you have any questions?**
- Passion

I do have a few questions. Thanks for asking. We talked a bit about your plans to invest in training opportunities for your current employees, especially those who will be managing the company's transition to a centralized billing system. I think that this is a great plan, and I'd love to support the curriculum development. Now, will most of the training modules be designed by this team? And will they be delivered in person, via webinar, or a video format? Or will you be using a hybrid approach? Why this answer worked well:She showed that she had been paying attention to the conversation.She wanted to delve a bit further into a topic that they’ve just discussed.She conveyed a lot of enthusiasm about supporting what sounds like a priority project for that organization.
