Hello Zac,

I recently had opportunity to chat with hiring recruiter at Teleport. While it didn't result in success this time, I must say I was truly impressed by the challenging and insightful interview process you have in place. As a Site Reliability Engineer with a strong passion for programming in Go, the experience left a lasting impression on me. 

Although I may not have secured a position or even move forward in the process this time around, I am determined to enhance my skills and knowledge. I find Teleport particularly appealing, especially after hearing from Shane about the exceptional company culture it boasts.

I've taken the initiative to independently tackle the challenge available at [https://github.com/gravitational/careers/tree/main/challenges/sre](https://github.com/gravitational/careers/tree/main/challenges/sre), not only because it's an excellent exercise but also to gauge and improve my abilities.

If you could spare a moment to read this message and consider accepting my connection request, I would greatly appreciate it. Cheesiness aside, I genuinely see a strong alignment between my interests and what Teleport embodies: a fantastic culture, cutting-edge technology, and a focus on programming â€“ three aspects I hold dear. If you want you can view the projects i have done over time here: https://99devops.com/projects

I am hoping if you would read this message and accept my connection request. 

Best regards,
Prabesh
