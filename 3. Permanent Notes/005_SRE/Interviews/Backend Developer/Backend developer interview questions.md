Conclusion, explain it further not 2-3 sentence. ( 35-45 )


1.  Tell me about yourself ? ( Elevator pinch ) - 
	1. BE in com eng
	2. Varicon python backend engineer
	3. re-implementing existing code base in DDD
2. Elaborate more on what you did
	1. pretty complex
	2. Django / Django rest framework
	3. maintain code 
	4. making it usable using DDD
3. Why did you choose DDD ?
	1. DDD focus on domain
	2. Ubiquitous language maps to real world
	3. Core domain  ( business ) - too tight
	4. DDD in core business in any framework language 
4. How
	1. Collaborate with domain experts 
	2. Design aggregate model
	3. Entities for that domain
	4. Value objects
	5. DDD pattern - repository pattern / service pattern
	6. re-iterate
5. Who are domain experts
	1. problem / 
6. Repository / service pattern ?
	1. repository pattern := SOLID principle 
		1. should depend on abstraction but not on detail
		2. Do not depend on the ORM, create an abstract repository class
		3. 
	2. asd
7. What ORM did you used 
	1. Django ORM
8. Why use / not use ORM = ORM
	1. what i feel
	2. Overkill for a small business application
9. What cloud service used in past ?
	1. Cloud infra - AWS  lamda
		1. What did you do on AWS lambada ? 
			1. API gateway / S3 / DynamoDB = 
	2. Google cloud functions  
10. What is TDD ? 
	1. putting test as part of the development
	2. advantage to while life cycle, confidence
	3. Fail early / fail early / rigid software
11. What are iterators ?
	1. iterates over iterable = 
	2. What is an iterable ? list / tuple
	3. What is an advantage over for loop ?
		1. iterator - lazy evaluation compares to for loop
		2. lazy evaluation - processing data one at a time, keeping object in memory
12. for loop vs iterator vs generators - 
	1. range is a generator function 
13. Decorator function python
	1. asd
14. Shallow copy and deep copy in python
	1. everything in python is an object
	2. normal copies: copies first layer of objects and assigns 
15. asd


Behavioral interview question

Difficult situation ( 30-35s ) 
	- To long answer ( STAR )


Describe a situation where you had to handle a tight deadline or work under pressure. How did you ensure the successful completion of the task?
	- Scrum
	- Sprints
	- prioritize tasks - Quantitatively 
		- How did you re-prioritise task ?
			- Team
			- Bugs - High
			- business requirement

Conflict resolution
	- reflecting on my own if i correct or not ( research, confused and second though what if)
	- went to him, thought make me understand his view points
	- finally both agreed our team lead educate us handle us. 
	- humor ( choose your battels, )
	- Solve


Do you have any questions
	- Prioritize people
	- How do you eval
	- 1:1
		- Set a goal for yourself, timeline against a goal, review the goal, analyze the goals
	-
