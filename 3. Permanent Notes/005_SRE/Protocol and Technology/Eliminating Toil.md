### What is Toil ?
A Toil is a repetitive work which can be automated and which does not add much value even after completion. Toil grows as the system / service complexity increases

### What are the disadvantages of toil ?
- Career stagnation
- Low morale
- Best engineer getting demotivated and start searching for other works
- New hires feel getting cheated upon
- dev punting more toil to SRE
- more time focused on working on toil, effectively reducing development velocity

### What should a SRE do ?
SRE should be spending 50% of their time on engineering work.

By engineering we mean software and system engineering work which includes works like feature development, writing actual code, configuration, system design, configuring os, load-balancer, creating tools etc.

### What are the types of works that SRE do ?
- System engineering
- Software Engineering
- Toil
- Overhead


### How to eliminate toil ?
If everyone focuses on reducing toil on weekly basis or regular basic, then it will eventually decrease

### Benefit of low toil 
If toil are less, SRE can focus more energy and time on feature development, designing next generation systems and services.
