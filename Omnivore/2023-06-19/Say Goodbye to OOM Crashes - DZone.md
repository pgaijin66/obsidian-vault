> What guarantees system stability in large data query tasks? It is an effective memory allocation and monitoring mechanism. It is how you speed up [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/say-goodbye-to-oom-crashes-d-zone-188d5a1a429#c595487a-07a6-4aab-95cf-6a883542c75b) 

> OOM errors cause backend processes to crash. To quote one of our community members: Hi, Apache Doris. It's okay to slow things down or fail a few tasks when you are short of memory, but throwing a downtime is just not cool.

> Luckily, those dark days are behind us because we have improved our memory management mechanism from the bottom up. Now get ready. Things are going to be intensive. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/say-goodbye-to-oom-crashes-d-zone-188d5a1a429#f901fa14-af9b-4f03-9ffe-05441236527a) 

> In Apache Doris, we have a one-and-only interface for memory allocation: **Allocator**. It will make adjustments as it sees appropriate to keep memory usage efficient and under control. Also, MemTrackers are in place to track the allocated or released memory size, and three different [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/say-goodbye-to-oom-crashes-d-zone-188d5a1a429#0b38b80f-ca30-4755-bd42-176576b6617d) 

> As different queries have different memory hotspot patterns in execution, Apache Doris provides three different in-memory data structures: **Arena**, **HashTable**, and **PODArray**. They are all under the reign of [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/say-goodbye-to-oom-crashes-d-zone-188d5a1a429#78028608-35e1-46af-b52d-ceccd5542f67)
