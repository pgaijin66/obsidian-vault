*Put individual thinking here*

Zettlekasten method help us in organizing information and retaining it for longer period of time. Most of the reading that we do are just thoughts and with monkey brain, mapping and linking such thoughts, knowledge becomes hard.

Zettelkasten method helps us to organize such thoughts and knowledge in a more productive manner

Each note in a zettlekasten method is called a zettle which consists of UID, Body and Refenrence. 

We structure these zettle into different notes
1. Fleetings notes
2. Literature notes
3. Permanent notes

Fleeting notes are the ideas or the quick notes that we capture while reading. They are crude and just highlight the key highlights of the reading.

In fleeting note we capture everything, every diea that comes to the mind. Put everything in one place for processing

Follow barrel of Method of reading while capturing fleeting notes


They are deleted over time


Should not cause any distractions

Literature notes are the summarization of the fleeting note prepared in author own words. This notes should be written to compass what the reader understood from the reading.  Here fleeting notes are taken as a reference gap to articulate understanding. This is basically assimilating information properly.

Keep it short and selective and use own owns

While writing literature note, we should think more articulately, why is it needed ? motivation behind the article ? Usefulness ? Drawbacks ? Pro and Con ?

Permanent notes are the final step. It is written in an understandable way and will be kept forever. This will be the source of information if you want to come back and have a look.

Write as if you are writing for someone else
