## Highlights

> How To Be Successful - Sam Altman [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-be-successful-sam-altman-188ac89b06a#96790aab-efa4-420d-8772-8084393fd51c) 

> **1\. Compound yourself**
> 
> Compounding is magic. Look for it everywhere. Exponential curves are the key to wealth generation. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-be-successful-sam-altman-188ac89b06a#f4e2dcf6-4361-4b1a-a6d5-94cf2819d96b) 

> you should aim for your life to follow an ever-increasing up-and-to-the-right trajectory. It’s important to move towards a career that has a compounding effect—most careers progress fairly linearly.
> 
> You don't want to be in a career where people who have been doing it for two years can be as effective as people who have been doing it for twenty—your rate of learning should always be high. As your career progresses, each unit of work you do should generate more and more results. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-be-successful-sam-altman-188ac89b06a#cc4c6b1c-a79a-4d44-b392-a690ea44d0ed) 

> There are many ways to get this leverage, such as capital, technology, brand, network effects, and managing people. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-be-successful-sam-altman-188ac89b06a#7a0e5bb6-0631-43fb-8e69-926d7c830710) 

> I am willing to take as much time as needed between projects to find my next thing. But I always want it to be a project that, if successful, will make the rest of my career look like a footnote. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-be-successful-sam-altman-188ac89b06a#3f0356ec-3353-4e27-bca9-657944e76ece) 

> One of the notable aspects of compound growth is that the furthest out years are the most important. In a world where almost no one takes a truly long-term view, the market richly rewards those who do.
> 
> Trust the exponential, be patient, and be pleasantly surprised. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-be-successful-sam-altman-188ac89b06a#7b623218-b890-488c-a4ea-d52468b9e317) 

> 2\. Have almost too much self-belief [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-be-successful-sam-altman-188ac89b06a#dffcbc2c-fdb6-4a4b-be90-a11d4c6a4091) 

> Self-belief is immensely powerful. The most successful people I know believe in themselves almost to the point of delusion.
> 
> Cultivate this early. As you get more data points that your judgment is good and you can consistently deliver results, trust yourself more. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-be-successful-sam-altman-188ac89b06a#3b43034b-8889-44d6-b02c-b379b05f7df8) 

> If you don’t believe in yourself, it’s hard to let yourself have contrarian ideas about the future. But this is where most value gets created. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-be-successful-sam-altman-188ac89b06a#aacb0103-a1b5-4d96-a5a7-8020e66c1a01) 

> Managing your own morale—and your team’s morale—is one of the greatest challenges of most endeavors. It’s almost impossible without a lot of self-belief. And unfortunately, the more ambitious you are, the more the world will try to tear you down. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-be-successful-sam-altman-188ac89b06a#b410eff0-1a08-41d6-a332-213a03ce6f5e) 

> Self-belief must be balanced with self-awareness. I used to hate criticism of any sort and actively avoided it. Now I try to always listen to it with the assumption that it’s true, and then decide if I want to act on it or not. Truth-seeking is hard and often painful, but it is what separates self-belief from self-delusion.
> 
> This balance also helps you avoid coming across as entitled and out of touch. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-be-successful-sam-altman-188ac89b06a#9462c57d-c828-4955-81ae-99a9223973b7) 

> **3\. Learn to think independently**
> 
> Entrepreneurship is very difficult to teach because original thinking is very difficult to teach. School is not set up to teach this—in fact, it generally rewards the opposite. So you have to cultivate it on your own. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-be-successful-sam-altman-188ac89b06a#571c694a-77dc-4eba-b2bc-d5a68e83dc6f) 

> Thinking from first principles and trying to generate new ideas is fun, and finding people to exchange them with is a great way to get better at this. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-be-successful-sam-altman-188ac89b06a#ed20d81d-afb5-4cea-9b93-dc9a3d1e0b5e) 

> The next step is to find easy, fast ways to test these ideas in the real world.
> 
> “I will fail many times, and I will be really right once” is the entrepreneurs’ way. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-be-successful-sam-altman-188ac89b06a#768ba280-c364-49f1-83ba-9eb2572454aa) 

> Grit comes from learning you can get back up after you get knocked down.
> 
> **4\. Get good at “sales”** [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-be-successful-sam-altman-188ac89b06a#3f481a6b-fc2b-440c-9e77-aa2c3dfbe634) 

> Self-belief alone is not sufficient—you also have to be able to convince other people of what you believe.
> 
> All great careers, to some degree, become sales jobs. You have to evangelize your plans to customers, prospective employees, the press, investors, etc. This requires an inspiring vision, strong communication skills, some degree of charisma, and evidence of execution ability. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-be-successful-sam-altman-188ac89b06a#8f606165-e8da-4b5a-ae16-6889048caf94) 

> My best advice for communicating clearly is to first make sure your thinking is clear and then use plain, concise language.
> 
> The best way to be good at sales is to genuinely believe in what you’re selling. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-be-successful-sam-altman-188ac89b06a#a54b3dea-6763-4409-87fa-44f3e8d80380) 

> Getting good at sales is like improving at any other skill—anyone can get better at it with deliberate practice. But for some reason, perhaps because it feels distasteful, many people treat it as something unlearnable. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-be-successful-sam-altman-188ac89b06a#5237e954-fbcc-45b6-a5e5-e3726f963f05) 

> When I was first starting out, I was always willing to get on a plane. It was frequently unnecessary, but three times it led to career-making turning points for me that otherwise would have gone the other way.
> 
> **5\. Make it easy to take risks** [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-be-successful-sam-altman-188ac89b06a#a436e96e-91be-449c-9d2d-3da32ba036cc) 

> Most people overestimate risk and underestimate reward. Taking risks is important because it’s impossible to be right all the time—you have to try many things and adapt quickly as you learn more. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-be-successful-sam-altman-188ac89b06a#8dd84409-7c37-4bec-a7d1-0a286553b3d0) 

> Look for small bets you can make where you lose 1x if you’re wrong but make 100x if it works. Then make a bigger bet in that direction. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-be-successful-sam-altman-188ac89b06a#db4b1ea6-072a-4036-8f17-ae1ec340cd3d) 

> Even if they do leave, the temptation to return is great. It’s easy—and human nature—to prioritize short-term gain and convenience over long-term fulfillment. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-be-successful-sam-altman-188ac89b06a#67dc780a-ab8b-41bc-a54e-6e7937fd079b) 

> **6\. Focus**
> 
> Focus is a force multiplier on work. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-be-successful-sam-altman-188ac89b06a#312b91d5-2fdd-4e97-a751-f126cfe1dfa0) 

> Almost everyone I’ve ever met would be well-served by spending more time thinking about what to focus on. It is much more important to work on the right thing than it is to work many hours. Most people waste most of their time on stuff that doesn’t matter.
> 
> Once you have figured out what to do, be unstoppable about getting your small handful of priorities accomplished quickly. I have yet to meet a slow-moving person who is very successful. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-be-successful-sam-altman-188ac89b06a#0faf0a12-6fb1-4b5f-b727-b8105f01ffd9) 

> **7\. Work hard**
> 
> You can get to about the 90th percentile in your field by working either smart or hard, which is still a great accomplishment. But getting to the 99th percentile requires both—you will be competing with other very talented people who will have great ideas and be willing to work a lot. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-be-successful-sam-altman-188ac89b06a#a93ac3f6-9dd9-4d45-9f1e-550be995ec7e) 

> One of the great joys in life is finding your purpose, excelling at it, and discovering that your impact matters to something larger than yourself. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-be-successful-sam-altman-188ac89b06a#faf0a6a8-2d4a-4191-bf29-e61b3efc8a31) 

> Working hard at that should be celebrated. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-be-successful-sam-altman-188ac89b06a#d550e4df-e95f-4f20-bce9-ed3c5559253f) 

> It’s not entirely clear to me why working hard has become a Bad Thing in certain parts of the US, but this is certainly not the case in other parts of the world [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-be-successful-sam-altman-188ac89b06a#379c2e0e-4167-4e9a-98b8-2676786f8746) 

> You have to figure out how to work hard without burning out. People find their own strategies for this, but one that almost always works is to find work you like doing with people you enjoy spending a lot of time with. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-be-successful-sam-altman-188ac89b06a#2ce6f467-67a0-4e81-a87f-0f4eef8b3a1f) 

> In fact, work stamina seems to be one of the biggest predictors of long-term success.
> 
> One more thought about working hard: do it at the beginning of your career. Hard work compounds like interest, and the earlier you do it, the more time you have for the benefits to pay off. It’s also easier to work hard when you have fewer other responsibilities [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-be-successful-sam-altman-188ac89b06a#c38177d3-c44c-4219-b6e0-59d05b9993ce) 

> **8\. Be bold**
> 
> I believe that it’s easier to do a hard startup than an easy startup. People want to be part of something exciting and feel that their work matters. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-be-successful-sam-altman-188ac89b06a#579d2136-7606-4bce-907b-879622096c62) 

> Let yourself grow more ambitious, and don’t be afraid to work on what you really want to work on. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-be-successful-sam-altman-188ac89b06a#e1065d80-8540-4bbe-bc67-e8e85b5a1e9d) 

> Follow your curiosity. Things that seem exciting to you will often seem exciting to other people too.
> 
> **9\. Be willful** [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-be-successful-sam-altman-188ac89b06a#99523b3f-434b-48fd-874e-14ad5f3840c4) 

> A big secret is that you can bend the world to your will a surprising percentage of the time—most people don’t even try, and just accept that things are the way that they are. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-be-successful-sam-altman-188ac89b06a#28168dde-69eb-42de-a156-56ba55409581) 

> Ask for what you want. You usually won’t get it, and often the rejection will be painful. But when this works, it works surprisingly well.  [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-be-successful-sam-altman-188ac89b06a#e02c5756-e5e4-455e-92fe-855da73a295e) 

> To be willful, you have to be optimistic—hopefully this is a personality trait that can be improved with practice. I have never met a very successful pessimistic person.
> 
> **10\. Be hard to compete with** [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-be-successful-sam-altman-188ac89b06a#2cbea5b8-0676-44cd-9289-6901b5a712b6) 

> Most people understand that companies are more valuable if they are difficult to compete with. This is important, and obviously true. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-be-successful-sam-altman-188ac89b06a#18ff30b0-8246-4677-bdc4-05c9e0d8806d) 

> If what you do can be done by someone else, it eventually will be, and for less money.
> 
> The best way to become difficult to compete with is to build up leverage. For example, you can do it with personal relationships, by building a strong personal brand, or by getting good at the intersection of multiple different fields. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-be-successful-sam-altman-188ac89b06a#c9b07cec-0a4e-4c7f-8fcd-9e4286bf7483) 

> There are many other strategies, but you have to figure out some way to do it. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-be-successful-sam-altman-188ac89b06a#8e2e23b1-247d-4e26-b2eb-f275e447a550) 

> This mimetic behavior is usually a mistake—if you’re doing the same thing everyone else is doing, you will not be hard to compete with.
> 
> **11\. Build a network** [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-be-successful-sam-altman-188ac89b06a#f6f01141-ebbe-4dfc-830e-0c3b45873df0) 

> Great work requires teams. Developing a network of talented people to work with—sometimes closely, sometimes loosely—is an essential part of a great career. The size of the network of really talented people you know often becomes the limiter for what you can accomplish.
> 
> An effective way to build a network is to help people as much as you can. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-be-successful-sam-altman-188ac89b06a#2bffbe91-2cd4-4816-8bd1-56312b09546e) 

> Doing this, over a long period of time, is what lead to most of my best career opportunities and three of my four best investments. I’m continually surprised how often something good happens to me because of something I did to help a founder ten years ago.
> 
> One of the best ways to build a network is to develop a reputation for really taking care of the people who work with you. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-be-successful-sam-altman-188ac89b06a#1a86e7ca-7def-4dc2-991f-c5728e39d6f9) 

> Be overly generous with sharing the upside; it will come back to you 10x. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-be-successful-sam-altman-188ac89b06a#ced04d91-196c-43a2-945e-b2c93098e931) 

> learn how to evaluate what people are great at, and put them in those roles. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-be-successful-sam-altman-188ac89b06a#1ad634d2-4943-4d23-8542-dbdfb36c5622) 

> You want to have a reputation for pushing people hard enough that they accomplish more than they thought they could, but not so hard they burn out.
> 
> Everyone is better at some things than others. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-be-successful-sam-altman-188ac89b06a#01654b1a-e501-4ccc-83cd-8576930cd768) 

> Define yourself by your strengths, not your weaknesses. Acknowledge your weaknesses and figure out how to work around them, but don’t let them stop you from doing what you want to do. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-be-successful-sam-altman-188ac89b06a#ba14dc46-1277-4ac0-9ad0-e428e72f33d5) 

> The best way to make up for your weaknesses is to hire complementary team members instead of just hiring people who are good at the same things you are.
> 
> A particularly valuable part of building a network is to get good at discovering undiscovered talent. Quickly spotting intelligence, drive, and creativity gets much easier with practice. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-be-successful-sam-altman-188ac89b06a#70acb924-bba0-4b80-ae8d-f3e749d5d864) 

> Remember that you are mostly looking for rate of improvement, and don’t overvalue experience or current accomplishment. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-be-successful-sam-altman-188ac89b06a#4c5c33dc-9cd4-414f-976d-740f9c4858d8) 

> It’s a pretty good heuristic for finding people who are likely to accomplish great things. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-be-successful-sam-altman-188ac89b06a#72f943b7-bc40-4a63-b319-d8b101256b6f) 

> Finally, remember to spend your time with positive people who support your ambitions.
> 
> **12\. You get rich by owning things** [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-be-successful-sam-altman-188ac89b06a#4b32d435-c51c-4cf9-9b06-8ee310136e0b) 

> The biggest economic misunderstanding of my childhood was that people got rich from high salaries. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-be-successful-sam-altman-188ac89b06a#f81f6161-8225-4ff5-a5e2-2c04e3bbb09c) 

> You get truly rich by owning things that increase rapidly in value.
> 
> This can be a piece of a business, real estate, natural resource, intellectual property, or other similar things. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-be-successful-sam-altman-188ac89b06a#3d4dd06f-925b-4a0f-a9a7-5b77e3240629) 

> you need to own equity in something, instead of just selling your time. Time only scales linearly. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-be-successful-sam-altman-188ac89b06a#a86a7446-a98f-4877-95db-d40f8f9c117a) 

> **13\. Be internally driven**
> 
> Most people are primarily externally driven; they do what they do because they want to impress other people. This is bad for many reasons, but here are two important ones. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-be-successful-sam-altman-188ac89b06a#1f6f6ad1-bbeb-4e42-b93c-940553b585d4) 

> you will work on consensus ideas and on consensus career tracks. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-be-successful-sam-altman-188ac89b06a#1b15ac5b-ad2e-48dc-984e-5ae5a1d173f0) 

> You will care a lot—much more than you realize—if other people think you’re doing the right thing. This will probably prevent you from doing truly interesting work, and even if you do, someone else would have done it anyway. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-be-successful-sam-altman-188ac89b06a#b426a85f-4854-4bef-9aab-6769943713f7) 

> You’ll be very focused on keeping up with other people and not falling behind in competitive games, even in the short term. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-be-successful-sam-altman-188ac89b06a#0e1f54ad-b66a-4a07-9e53-b82000a8b13a) 

> The most successful people I know are primarily internally driven; they do what they do to impress themselves and because they feel compelled to make something happen in the world. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-be-successful-sam-altman-188ac89b06a#ec455262-424b-4d66-aa10-0d8b0f40de61) 

> After you’ve made enough money to buy whatever you want and gotten enough social status that it stops being fun to get more, this is the only force I know of that will continue to drive you to higher levels of performance.
> 
> This is why the question of a person’s motivation is so important. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-be-successful-sam-altman-188ac89b06a#5fc4ba2e-de63-4807-9c1b-bc05afc1c0c5) 

> The right motivations are hard to define a set of rules for, but you know it when you see it. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-be-successful-sam-altman-188ac89b06a#f8cd0652-a98f-42ec-b953-16ed1ab47e5e) 

> Eventually, you will define your success by performing excellent work in areas that are important to you. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-be-successful-sam-altman-188ac89b06a#9bbc30a6-fd0b-4e6f-ba5f-ba45689a3499) 

> The sooner you can start off in that direction, the further you will be able to go. It is hard to be wildly successful at anything you aren’t obsessed with. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-be-successful-sam-altman-188ac89b06a#f3a374a4-fbf6-4e59-bbbc-fb6a0f2a1e6b)
