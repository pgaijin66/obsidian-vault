Poly1305 is like a special lock that you put on your scrambled message. It makes sure that nobody can change your message without you knowing. It's like putting a seal on your letter to make sure it stays the same. If someone tries to tamper with your message, the lock will break, and you'll know that something is wrong.

Poly1305, on the other hand, is an authentication algorithm. Its purpose is to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the encrypted message. It takes the ciphertext produced by ChaCha20 and generates a short authentication tag. This tag acts as a unique fingerprint for the encrypted message. If anyone tries to modify the ciphertext or tamper with the data, the authentication tag will change, alerting the recipient that the message has been compromised.
