### Recovery Time Objective ( RTO )
- RTO refers to the maximum acceptable downtime or the amount of time it takes to restore systems, applications, or services after an incident
- It represents target time within which operation should be resumed to avoid significant negative impact on business
- Factors to consider before setting: Criticality, customer expectations, impact of downtime on revenue and reputation
- Shorter RTO require more sophisticated and costly recovery solutions.

### Recovery Point Objective ( RPO )
- RPO defines the maximum acceptable amount of data loss measured in time.
- IT represents the point in time to which data must be recovered after a disruption or incident.
- RPO is determined by considering factors such as frequency of backups, amount of data generated or modified, tolerable data loss for the business.
- A shorter RPO means minimal data loss, while longer RPO allows for greater data loss before the incident occurred.

### How they work together

- RTO sets the recovery time expectations, which helps to determine type of backup solution, system redundancy, and recovery process needed to achieve the desired downtime.
- RPO influences frequency of data backups, replication strategies, storage requirement to meet the target recovery point.
- Organizations with stringent RTO and RPO requirements may employ techniques like CDP, real time replication, and HA configurations.

### CDP ( Continuous Data Protection )

CDP backup and replicates data changes in real time or at frequent interval



RTO and RPO needs to be regularly accessed and reviews to ensure they align with evolving business needs, regulatory requirements and technological advancements.
