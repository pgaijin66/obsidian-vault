# Toil
Created date: 2023-06-11 16:04

If a human needs to interact with the system during normal operation hours of the service, there it's is a clear sign that there is a bug

A Toil is the kind of work which is **repetitive, grows linearly as systems / services grows, does not adds value when completed, can be automated and tactical.**

Toil is not same as overhead

Overhead are the works like meetings, administrative works, hiring, peer review, trainings etc.

50% of the SRE time should be spend on engineering works ( which includes building stuffs) which effectively will reduce toil as an effect. Remaining 50% can be used to eliminate toil and overhead.

Engineering in SRE means reducing toil.

If some SRE complains out too much toil then it is a clear indication that either toils should be distributed among the team properly or team work on reducing it altogether.

SRE performs different activities such as 
	- software engineering: This includes writing code, creating scripts, adding features to service, designing system
	- system engineering: This includes configuration servers, system, hardening, networking, load-balancing configuration etc
	- toil: repetitive work which can be automated
	- overhead: hr administrative works

Toil is not always bad, as long as it is low it is good as it provides some sense of quick achievement. 

When toil grows larger then it starts to cause a lot of issues such as career stagnation, low morale.

There are other effects such as 
- It creates confusion on who is responsible for doing what if SRE are always doing the toil work
- New hire feels cheated as they did not expected this
- product release velocity goes down
- If SRE always do the toil work, dev start to think that it is okay to punt more toil work to SRE
- It demotivates effective engineers and they will start looking somewhere for new job

We all should spend sometime each week to eliminate toil and clean up as our service grows.

If we focus on these, then we can spend more time on engineering works and building next generation of system.
