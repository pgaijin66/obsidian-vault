Also interviewing for SRE roles with two years of experience. Here's what I've seen so far in the interviews:

- Excellent knowledge of linux
- Linux - system boot process, virtual memory, interrupts, signals - it was a very deep dive round, they keep digging you to check your depth in a topic.
- Focussed on back of envelope calculations, given a system with a certain cpu, memory, network and disk spec, they'll give a problem and ask you if that can be solved on this system in a given time. (I'll suggest reading NALSD section of google sre handbook)
    
- Experience with configuration management, CI/CD (related to this: Blue-Green deployments) , automation and monitoring.
    
- Experience in containers, container orchestration
    
- Scripting knowledge. Know how to do simple HTTP requests, filesystem processing, text parsing + knowledge of the language and the data structures
    
- Networking
    

And a lot of other things but it varies based on your experience and the role. Personally, my coding interviews involved SRE-type work and not leetcode questions.
