It is a tendency for us to gather information as much as we can so that we can feel good about it

We generally do this for intellectual stimulation

We pile up promising books and articles and store half ot the internet as bookmarks

This stimulates our brain in feeling as if we are on the tip of the cutting edge

This is known as collectors fallacy

Why fallacy ? 

because to know something is not same as knowing something. Just knowing about a thing is less superficial since we only know about its existence and nothing more.

This fake knowledge hinders us on the road of true excellence

Until we merge the contents, information, ideas and discussion with other people into our own, we haven't really learned a topic

We don't change ourself if we don't learn, so merely filling things away doesn't lead us anywhere

*Collections make us drown in liabilities*

## Research, Read, Assimilate; Rinse and Repeat


### Forming a habit
1. Research on topic you want to learn about ( Blog, book, content, discussions, 5 Why etc)
2. Read for 1 hour 
3. Reflect your knowledge. Reflect if you learned something new. 
4. Assimilate the highlights texts of things you found interesting
6. Organize them into cards ( Since space is limited, try to use as less word as you can make it )
7. Reflect; did you learn anything new ? Too much or too less
8. Save the essential information in documentation ( in your own words) form the cards
9. Now write or produce something based on the information you just retained. This helps you identify the gap in knowledge
