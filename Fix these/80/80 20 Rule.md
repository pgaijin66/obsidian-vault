## Chapter 1 Welcome to 80/20 principle







## Chapter 2 - How to think 80 / 20
- **Definition of the 80/20 Principle:** The 80/20 Principle states that an imbalance exists between causes and results, inputs and outputs, and effort and reward. It divides causes, inputs, or effort into two categories: a majority with little impact and a minority with a major impact.
    
- **80/20 Analysis and 80/20 Thinking:** Two practical applications of the principle are introduced - 80/20 Analysis and 80/20 Thinking. These approaches help understand and improve various aspects of life by focusing on the key factors that drive significant outcomes.
    
- **Unbalanced Relationships:** The relationship between causes/inputs/effort and results/outputs/rewards is typically unbalanced. About 80% of results come from 20% of causes, forming an 80/20 relationship. Examples include wealth distribution, energy consumption, and disease prevalence.
    
- **Visualizing 80/20:** Using visual representations, such as bar charts, helps illustrate the 80/20 relationship. For instance, in a company with 100 products, the most profitable 20 products contribute to 80% of the profits, while the remaining 80 products generate only 20% of profits.
    
- **Variations in the 80/20 Ratio:** While the standard 80/20 ratio is commonly used, variations like 70/30 or 90/10 can also be observed. The key point is that an imbalance between causes and results is common, often resembling the 80/20 pattern.
    
- **Application of the Principle:** Embracing the 80/20 Principle leads to insightful changes. Concentrating on the vital 20% of inputs can significantly impact outcomes. Examples include efficient studying, focusing on key exam topics, and targeting essential clients/products for business growth.
    
- **Two Approaches: 80/20 Analysis and 80/20 Thinking:**
    
    - **80/20 Analysis:** Quantitative method using data analysis to establish the relationship between causes and results. Provides precise insights based on actual data.
    - **80/20 Thinking:** Intuitive approach that estimates the relationship between inputs and outputs without extensive data analysis. Useful for quick decision-making and identifying key factors.

- **Avoid Linear Thinking:** Applying 80/20 Analysis linearly or without considering context can lead to misinterpretation. Linear thinking assumes that the most commonly observed variables are always the most significant, which may not hold true.

- **Importance of 80/20 Thinking:** 80/20 Thinking is essential for practical applications as it allows quick decision-making and identifies the vital few factors. It complements 80/20 Analysis, enabling effective and efficient actions.
    
- **Mindset Change:** Applying the 80/20 Principle involves shifting one's perspective towards exceptional productivity, focusing on essential inputs, and concentrating on high-impact activities for improved results in various aspects of life

## Chapter 3 The underground cult
**The First 80/20 Wave: The Quality Revolution**

- The quality revolution between 1950 and 1990 transformed the quality and value of consumer goods through statistical and behavioral techniques.
- Joseph Juran and W Edwards Deming, pioneers of the movement, found success in Japan after facing little interest in the US.
- Japanese products entering the US market forced Western corporations to take quality seriously.
- The 80/20 Principle (Pareto Principle) was a key part of the quality movement, identifying crucial defects causing most quality problems.

**The Second 80/20 Wave: The Information Revolution**

- The information revolution from the 1960s onwards transformed work habits and business efficiency.
- The 80/20 Principle played a key role in this revolution, guiding software and hardware development.
- The 80/20 Principle was used to enhance selectivity and simplicity in innovative solutions.
- The information revolution's subversive force empowered front-line workers and decentralized corporations.

**Why the 80/20 Principle Works in Business**

- The 80/20 theory of the firm suggests that the most successful firms generate high revenues with minimal effort.
- Firms should focus on high-surplus segments and products and aim for higher margins than competitors.
- It's possible to raise surplus by reallocating resources and reducing inequality of output and reward.
- Success in business results from identifying small causes with significant consequences.

**How Companies Can Use the 80/20 Principle to Raise Profits**

- The 80/20 Principle helps isolate profitable and unprofitable segments in a business.
- Understanding where true profits and losses occur can transform a business.
- The 80/20 Principle can be practically applied to various aspects of a business for increased profitability.
- Embedding 80/20 Thinking in business strategies can provide a competitive advantage. 


#### Chapter 4: Why your strategy is wrong ?
## Chapter 4 WHY YOUR STRATEGY IS WRONG
In order to improve profitability, it's essential to identify the most lucrative aspects of your business. This involves conducting an 80/20 Analysis, which can reveal that a small portion of your products or activities generates the majority of your profits, enabling strategic decisions to enhance sales and profitability.
#### Where are you making most money

**Step 1:** Look at different parts of your business, like products or customers.

**Step 2:** For products, check how much they sell and how much money they make after considering all costs.

**Step 3:** If you don't have all the cost info, try to figure it out as best as you can.

**Step 4:** Divide the costs fairly among the products. Don't just use a percentage of sales because some products might need more time or money to sell.

**Step 5:** After all that, look at the results. Some products make a lot of money, some make a little, and some might even lose money.

**Step 6:** Find out which products bring in the most profits. In our example, we found that Products A, B, and C make the most money.

**Step 7:** Now, think about how to sell more of those profitable products. Maybe focus on them and not worry so much about the others.

**Step 8:** You can also think about ways to save money or charge more for products that aren't making much profit.

**Step 9:** If some products are really not doing well, you might even consider stopping them or making big changes.

**Step 10:** Keep track of how things change as you make these decisions, and adjust your strategy accordingly.

Remember, the goal is to make more money by concentrating on what's working best for your business.


#### What about customer profitability
- Analyze customer profitability after assessing product profitability.
- Customers can differ in terms of how much they pay and the cost to serve them.
- Small customers may pay high prices but have high servicing costs, while large customers may demand lower prices.
- The analysis for Electronic Instruments Inc (Figures 14 and 15) reveals varying customer profitability.
- Customer groups (Type A, B, C, D) are explained: Type A offers high margins but is costly to serve, Type B are distributors with low servicing costs, Type C pays high prices but is expensive to serve, and Type D bargains on price and requires technical support.
- Figures 16 and 17 present the 80/20 Table and Chart for customer profitability, showing that a small percentage of customers (15%) generates a large portion (59%) of profits.
- This led to strategies such as targeting more Type A and B customers, selectively raising prices for Type C, and addressing servicing costs for Type D.
- The chapter also mentions applying the 80/20 Analysis to other business splits, such as large projects versus small projects in a consultancy firm (Figures 18 and 19) and old clients versus new clients (Figures 20 and 21).
- In the consultancy example, it's found that a small percentage of projects (21%) generates a significant portion (56%) of profits, emphasizing the importance of focusing on large projects and retaining long-serving clients.
- Further analysis divides projects into M&A, strategic analysis, and operational projects, revealing that M&A work is highly profitable (87% of profits for 22% of revenues).
- The results led to targeted efforts to sell more M&A work and avoid operational projects for new clients.


#### 80/20 Analysis applied to a consultancy firm

- Apply the 80/20 Analysis to other aspects of your business.
- For a consultancy firm, analyze the split of business into various categories.
- Consider the example of a strategy consultancy shown in Figures 18 and 19.
- The analysis reveals a 56/21 rule, indicating that large projects account for only 21% of turnover but generate 56% of profits.
- Another analysis (Figures 20 and 21) divides clients into 'old,' 'intermediate,' and 'new' clients.
- It shows that old clients (26% of the business) contribute to 84% of profits, highlighting the importance of retaining and expanding long-serving clients.
- New clients that don't become long-serving clients are identified as loss makers, leading to a more selective approach to pitching for business.
- Figures 22 and 23 summarize a third analysis that categorizes projects into M&A, strategic analysis, and operational projects.
- This analysis demonstrates an 87/22 rule, indicating that M&A work is highly profitable, contributing to 87% of profits for 22% of revenues.
- As a result, efforts were intensified to sell more M&A work, and operational projects for new clients were avoided due to significant losses. Old clients were either charged more for such projects or encouraged to seek specialized operational consultancies.

#### Segmentation is the key to understanding and driving up profitability
- To understand and improve profitability, segment your business into competitive segments.
- Competitive segments are parts of your business where you face different competitors or competitive dynamics.
- Identify competitive segments by asking if you face different main competitors in that part of the business.
- Also, consider whether you and your competitor have the same ratio of sales or market share in different areas.
- Competitive segments allow you to develop strategies specific to each segment, taking into account the competitor's influence.
- In the case of Electronic Instruments Inc., the company divided its business into 15 large segments based on products and geographic regions.
- Analyze the sales and profits of each segment to uncover imbalances.
- Prioritize segments based on profitability and market attractiveness.
- Focus your efforts on the most profitable and attractive segments, potentially increasing sales efforts and adjusting pricing.
- Consider "harvesting" less attractive segments by reducing effort and raising prices.
- De-emphasize segments that are structurally unattractive, even if you have a leading market share.
- Decide the fate of loss-making segments based on their potential for improvement and alignment with the company's long-term strategy.

### Don’t take 80/20 Analysis to simplistic conclusions

- 80/20 profit analysis provides a snapshot of profitability at a specific point in time but doesn't consider trends or factors that could change profitability.
- It's important to remember that analyzing profitability is necessary but not sufficient for forming a good strategy.
- Stopping losses is a crucial step in improving profitability.
- In the example, 80/20 profit analysis was generally accurate for 14 out of 15 segments, covering over 90% of revenues.
- Strategic analysis should begin with 80/20 analysis but should also consider segment market attractiveness and the company's position in each segment.
- Actions taken by the company included focusing management efforts, raising sales efforts, flexibility in pricing, holding positions, harvesting unattractive segments, reducing effort, gaining market share, and selling/closing certain segments.
- The actions were determined based on the segment's attractiveness, the company's position, and profitability.
- The goal is to maximize profitability and market position across all segments.

### 80/20 as a guide to the future—developing your firm into a different animal

- The 80/20 Principle is not just valuable for analyzing profitability in existing business segments but can also identify opportunities for future growth and innovation.
- Rather than assuming that industries and organizations are operating optimally, consider that there is room for improvement and transformation.
- Innovation is essential for future competitive advantage, and the 80/20 Principle can facilitate creative thinking.
- To foster innovation, consider various 80/20-based ideas:
    - Identify the most profitable industries and explore how your industry can emulate their success.
    - Analyze the top-performing firms in your industry and learn from their strategies.
    - Determine the 20% of activities that provide 80% of the perceived value to customers and consider expanding those activities.
    - Identify the 80% of activities in your industry that yield only 20% of the customer benefit and explore eliminating them.
    - Recognize that 80% of the benefit of a product or service can often be delivered at only 20% of the cost.
    - Understand that 80% of an industry's profits often come from 20% of its customers; strive to gain a larger share of these customers.
- Industries can transform by embracing self-service, discounting, automation, and other innovative approaches.
- Consider shifting from a product-based model to a service-based one, such as leasing rather than selling.
- The Interface Corporation's carpet leasing model, based on the 80/20 Principle, transformed its business and could influence the entire industry.

### Conclusion
The 80/20 Principle reveals that your current strategy may be flawed. When a small portion of your activities generates the majority of your profits, it's essential to shift your company's focus and prioritize the expansion of this profitable segment. However, this is just one aspect of the strategy. Beyond the necessity for focus, there is a more profound business truth that we'll explore in the next section.

80% time - 20% ( not important work )
### Summary: 

Certainly, here's an overall summary of the key points discussed in your previous questions:

1. **Segmentation for Profitability Analysis**:
   - To understand and enhance profitability, it's essential to segment your business.
   - Competitive segments are parts of your business where you face different competitors or competitive dynamics.
   - Use questions like whether you face different main competitors and whether competitive ratios vary to identify segments.

2. **Analysis for Strategy**:
   - 80/20 Analysis of profitability is a fundamental starting point for crafting business strategy.
   - It provides insights into which segments are the most profitable.

3. **Segment Prioritization**:
   - Prioritize segments based on profitability, market attractiveness, and your company's positioning within each segment.
   - Allocate resources and effort accordingly, focusing on the most profitable and attractive segments.

4. **Innovation and Transformation**:
   - The 80/20 Principle is valuable not only for analyzing but also for innovating and transforming your business.
   - Challenge the status quo and consider industry and organizational transformations.
   - Examples include self-service models, discounting, automation, and rethinking traditional approaches.

5. **Focus and Concentration**:
   - If a small part of your business generates most of your profits, shift your company's focus to grow that profitable segment.
   - Concentrate efforts on multiplying the success of this small part.

6. **The Deeper Truth**:
   - Beyond the need for focus, there's a more profound truth in business strategy.
   - This deeper truth goes beyond the 80/20 Principle and requires a broader perspective on business dynamics and strategy.

These principles underscore the importance of continually analyzing and refining your business strategy to adapt to changing market conditions and seize opportunities for growth and innovation.

### Chapter 5: Simplicity is beautiful

- The 80/20 Principle suggests that a small portion (20%) of a company's revenues generates the majority (80%) of its profits.
    - Example: In a retail company, 20% of the product lines might contribute to 80% of the profits, with high-end electronics being a significant profit driver.
- Managers often resist acting on the 80/20 Principle, assuming that less profitable segments significantly contribute to overhead costs.
- managers are reluctant to shut down or restructure the unprofitable parts of the business because they believe that even though these parts are not making money on their own, they are still essential to keep the company running by offsetting the fixed costs. This is often seen as a reasonable argument because eliminating a large portion of the business may indeed reduce the company's overall revenue, making it more challenging to cover fixed costs and potentially impacting short-term profits.

- However, the author seems to be suggesting that this perspective is based on a misunderstanding. The unprofitable part of the business is unprofitable precisely because it requires these overheads and because the company has too many different and often complex segments. Instead, the author argues for a focus on simplicity and eliminating the unprofitable parts, which may still lead to profitability while reducing complexity and overhead costs.
    - Example: A manufacturing company may hesitate to eliminate less profitable products, thinking they cover significant overhead costs.
- Complexity in business operations, often driven by pursuing more revenue streams, can lead to decreased profitability.
    - Example: A software company can reduce costs and maintain profitability by focusing on a core set of features and eliminating less-used ones.
- Simplifying operations and understanding cost structures can lead to higher returns on investment.
    - Example: A retail store streamlines its product offerings and marketing around profitable categories to increase sales and profits.
- Embracing simplicity and reducing complexity can help unlock a business's true profit potential.
    - Example: The 80/20 Principle demonstrates that a smaller, more focused portion of a business can be significantly more profitable than the rest

#### Does this mean simplicity is beautiful ?
bigger is always better  is not always true

The passage highlights the paradox of larger firms losing market share to smaller competitors despite the perceived advantages of scale and market dominance. It suggests that this phenomenon is often linked to the hidden costs of complexity within larger organizations, which can impede profitability despite increased sales and market share.

#### Cost of complexity
- The key challenge affecting business profitability is not merely scaling up but the associated increase in complexity.
- Scaling up, if it doesn't introduce complexity, generally leads to lower unit costs and improved returns.
- However, scaling often involves adapting existing products, introducing new ones, or offering additional services, which results in hidden overhead costs.
- Dealing with new customers with distinct needs further amplifies this complexity and cost.
- This complexity is a critical factor that hinders the translation of scale and market share into higher profitability in practice.

The challenge in achieving higher business profitability lies not just in scaling up but in managing the complexity that often accompanies growth, leading to hidden overhead costs that can hinder the expected gains from increased scale and market share.

#### Internal complexity has huge hidden costs

- Internal complexity incurs significant hidden costs in business operations.
- When new business activities differ even slightly from existing ones, costs tend to rise disproportionately due to the complications introduced.
- Complexity slows down straightforward processes and necessitates managerial intervention to address new demands.
- Costs arise from interruptions, communication challenges, and the gaps between tasks when work transitions between individuals or departments.
- When communication spans various divisions, buildings, or countries, these costs escalate.
- The depicted Figure 31 illustrates that although competitor B is larger than competitor A, it experiences higher costs due to increased complexity, outweighing any visible cost advantages associated with scaling up.
#### Simple is beautiful explains the 80/20 principle
- Understanding the cost of complexity is crucial for the corporate size debate, highlighting that big can be beautiful if it's simple, and simplicity is always beautiful.
- Recent studies show that simplicity differentiates successful companies, and this mental breakthrough helps explain the 80/20 Principle's validity by emphasizing the value of simple and pure market share, mature and simple business segments, strategic outsourcing, eliminating central functions, and focusing on customer needs.

    - Understanding the cost of complexity is essential in the debate about corporate size.
- Large companies can be beautiful if they are simple, but complexity makes them ugly and expensive.
- Recent studies show that simplicity differentiates successful companies, and a simple organization is best at selling complex products.
- The 80/20 Principle is explained by simplicity, as a fifth of revenues can generate four-fifths of profits, and the top 20% of revenues can be 16 times more profitable.
- Simple and pure market share is highly valuable, overshadowing the cost of complexity associated with impure scale.
- Mature and simple parts of a business can be remarkably profitable, as reducing products, customers, and suppliers lowers complexity and overhead costs.
**- Outsourcing is an effective way to cut complexity and costs, focusing on a company's comparative advantage.**
**- Eliminating central functions and costs, such as head offices, can boost profits by refocusing on customer needs.**
- Simplicity also leads to higher prices as customers value a straightforward, attentive approach.

#### Contributions to overhead: One of the lamest excuse of inaction
**- Managers sometimes resist focusing on the most profitable segments due to the argument that less profitable or loss-making segments contribute positively to overheads.**
- **This argument is criticized as weak and self-serving because concentrating on profitable segments can lead to rapid growth,** often at a rate of around 20% per year or even faster.
- Overhead coverage from unprofitable segments may become unnecessary as profitable segments expand.
- **Managers can choose to remove or sell less profitable segments, and so-called "exit costs" should not deter them, as these costs often have a quick payback, thanks to the value of simplicity.**
- Another profitable approach **is to harvest less profitable segments intentionally, letting go of less profitable customers and products, reducing support and sales efforts, raising prices, and allowing sales to decline while increasing overall profitability.**

#### Go for the most simple 20 per cent
1. Simplicity and standardization lead to increased productivity and cost-effectiveness compared to complexity.
2. Simple messages have universal appeal and are attractive to colleagues, consumers, and suppliers.
3. Identify and cultivate the simplest 20% in various aspects of your business, standardize delivery on a global scale, prioritize quality and consistency, and simplify or eliminate complexity when necessary.


#### Reducing complexity at corning ( case study )
- Corning, a ceramic substrate manufacturer for auto exhaust systems, faced financial difficulties in its US and German operations in the 1990s.
- Instead of panicking, Corning applied the 80/20 Principle to assess the profitability of its products, revealing that a few high-volume, simple products were highly profitable, while many low-volume, complex products were unprofitable.
- They conducted a detailed cost analysis, which showed that certain low-volume products had significantly higher costs due to extra engineering and shop floor effort.
- By eliminating the low-volume, unprofitable products and focusing on high-profit items, Corning reduced complexity, streamlined operations, and cut engineering costs by 25 percent.
- Corning also applied the 50/5 Principle, finding that 50 percent of their products contributed only a small fraction of revenues and profits.
- They reduced the number of products by more than half, consolidated suppliers, and streamlined the organization.
- Contrary to conventional wisdom, Corning turned away business to simplify operations, which led to rapid profit restoration and demonstrated that less complexity can be more profitable.

#### Managers love complexity
Because it's challenging and appealing

#### Cost reduction through simplicity
Organization always great potential for cost reduction and for delivering value by just simplify what it does and eliminate low negative yielding activities

#### Reducing costs using 80/20 principle
- Reducing costs using the 80/20 Principle involves 
- **simplification**, focus on key drivers of improvement, and performance comparison.
- **Selectively tackle areas with the greatest cost-reduction potential, concentrating 80% of efforts there, avoiding excessive microanalysis.
- **Identify productive costs, eliminate unproductive ones,** and measure what truly matters for customer satisfaction.
- **Use 80/20 Analysis to pinpoint improvement** areas by identifying the significant causes of cost overruns.
- **Compare performance**, focusing on the majority of laggards to improve to the level of the best, using techniques like benchmarking and best demonstrated practice.
- **Place cost-reduction techniques within the context of the 80/20 Principle to drive radical action and deliver value to customers.**

Example
- A book publishing company is facing cost overruns in its typesetting process.
- To address this issue, they decide to apply the 80/20 Principle to identify the main causes of these cost overruns.
- They monitor and record the reasons for the cost overruns over a specific period.
- They create an 80/20 Chart to visually represent the causes, listing them in descending order of importance.
- The chart shows that about 20% of the causes (the top three issues) are responsible for nearly 80% of the cost overruns, and these issues all relate to authors.
- Based on this analysis, the publishing house can implement targeted solutions, such as modifying author contracts to hold them accountable for extra typesetting costs caused by their lateness or corrections.
- This approach allows the company to focus on the most critical factors contributing to cost overruns and address them effectively.
#### Conclusion
Simplicity is the greatest sophistication

A simple business, when compared to a complex one, is inherently better due to reduced waste and increased efficiency, while larger businesses tend to be more valuable if they maintain simplicity. 

Achieving greatness and delivering better value to customers involves simplifying, as large businesses often have unprofitable elements that hinder progress and require a ruthless approach to elimination.

## Chapter 6: Hooking the right customers

- Previously focused on mass production, without customer or marketing needs
- In fact the Fordist approach was plainly the the right one for its time; the mission to simplify

### The 1960s rediscovered marketing and the 1990s rediscovered customers
- Theodore Levitt told managers to be ‘customer satisfying’ rather than ‘goods producing'
- 1960
	- Marketing became the hot topic
	- product and customer segmentation became the watchwords of the wise.
- 1990
	- customer satisfaction, customer centeredness, customer delight and customer obsession have become the stated goals of most enlightened and successful corporations.
	**	- The customer-led approach is both right and dangerous**
- chasing too many customers can escalate marketing and selling costs
### 80/20 marketing gospel
- markets and customers on which any firm should be centered must be the right ones
- 3 golden rules
	- Marketing, and the whole firm, should focus on providing a stunning product and service in 20 per cent of the existing product line
	- should devote extraordinary endeavor towards delighting, keeping for ever and expanding the sales to the 20 per cent of customers who provide 80 per cent of the firm’s sales and/or profits.
	- different and, for your target customers, either unobtainable elsewhere, or provided by you in a product/service/price package that is much better value than is obtainable elsewhere. the creative marketeer must become product led. All innovation is necessarily product led. You cannot innovate without a new product or service.
- Be marketing led in the few right product/market segments
	- The logical thing to do is to expand the area devoted to the 20 per cent of most profitable
- Be customer centre for the few right customer
- Four steps to lock in your core customers
	- know who their key customers are
	- provide quite exceptional or even ‘outrageous’ service to them.
	- target new products and services at the core 20 per cent of customers, developing them solely for and with this group.
	- you should aim to keep your core customers for ever. Your core customers are money in the bank. If any of them drops out, your profitability will suffer.
### Serving the core 20 per cent of customer must be a company wide obsession

### Selling
- Sales is marketing’s close cousin: the front-line activity to communicate to and, at least as important, to listen to customers.
- The top 20 per cent of salespeople generate between 70 and 80 per cent of sales.
- The next best thing to staying close to your customers is to stay close to the top salespeople
- Keep them happy; this cannot be done mainly with cash.
- Only train those who you are reasonably sure plan to stick around with you for several years.
- Get those who are the best salespeople to train them, rewarding the sales superstars according to the subsequent performance of their trainees.
- Invest the most training in those who perform best after the first tranche of training. Take the best 20 per cent of the trainees and invest 80
#### Vital few customers
- Do not focus on all the customers, but only focus on few which are vital to company or business


## Chapter 7: The top 10 business uses of the 80/20 principle

1. Strategy - c4,5
2. Quality - c3
3. Cost reduction and service improvement c5
4. Marketing - c6
5. Selling - c6
6. IT - c3
7. Decision taking and analysis
8. Inventory management
9. Project management
10. Negotiation
#### Decision taking and analysis
- Business decisions are crucial but often made without certainty of their outcome.
- Management science and analytical approaches have become prominent in business since the 1950s, driven by data gathering and analysis.
- Analysis has led to corporate bloat, fads, and overemphasis on short-term earnings in the stock market.
- Over-reliance on analysis has diminished visionary leadership in corporations.
- The 80/20 Principle emphasizes that a small portion of efforts yield significant results.
- **Five rules for decision-making with the 80/20 Principle:
    1. Most decisions are not highly important; delegate or make quick choices for unimportant ones.
    2. Critical turning points may go unnoticed; rely on intuition and insight.
    3. For important decisions, gather most data and perform relevant analyses early, then act decisively.
    4. If a decision isn't working, change course promptly; trust market feedback over excessive analysis.
    5. When something is successful, invest heavily; seize opportunities for exponential growth.**
### Inventory management
- Simplification in product offerings is crucial for effective stock management, following the 80/20 Principle.
- Most businesses have an excess of stock due to too many products and variants.
- Typically, around 80% of stock only contributes to 20% of volume or revenue, making slow-moving stock costly and unprofitable.
- Examples illustrate the 80/20 rule: 20% of SKUs accounting for 75% of volume in one case, and 0.5% accounting for 70% of activity in another.
- Filofax's example demonstrates the negative impact of excessive product variants and complexity on stock management and profitability.
- **Four key points for effective stock management:
    1. Cut down on unprofitable products.
    2. Reduce the number of product variants, starting with slow movers.
    3. Shift inventory management costs to suppliers or customers, or ideally, avoid physical handling through technology.
    4. Use the 80/20 Principle tactically to optimize picking and packing.**
- Inventory management is evolving with the adoption of virtual inventory and customer-intimate systems, driven by a focus on simplicity and customer needs.
- The 80/20 Principle is applicable in project management, another critical component of corporate value creation.
### Project management
- Management structures are often found to be inadequate and can even be detrimental, destroying more value than they add.
- Projects are a way to bypass or work around these structures to create value for valuable customers.
- Many energetic business professionals, from CEOs to lower-level employees, primarily engage in projects rather than traditional job roles.
- Project management is a unique task that involves teamwork, but also requires innovation and ad hoc arrangements.
- The role of a project manager is to focus the team on the most important aspects of the project.
- Projects are not singular endeavors; they often consist of multiple interrelated tasks or themes.
- The complexity of a project increases exponentially with the number of aims it encompasses.
- **80% of a project's value comes from 20% of its activities, while the remaining 80% arises from unnecessary complexity.**
- **Imposing a tight time scale encourages the team to focus on high-value tasks and discard non-essential features.**
- Stretch targets inspire creative solutions and force the application of the 80/20 rule.
- Careful planning is crucial, especially when time is limited; projects with a higher ratio of planning time to execution time tend to be better managed.
- During the planning phase, critical issues should be identified, hypotheses constructed, information gathered, and responsibilities assigned.
- In design projects, getting the design right in the initial phase is crucial to avoid costly overruns and rework later on.
### Negotiation
Applying the 80/20 Principle to negotiations is a key aspect of my top 10 business applications. While negotiation has been extensively studied, the 80/20 Principle introduces two critical points.

1. Emphasize the Few Crucial Points:
    - In any negotiation, a small fraction (20% or fewer) of the issues hold the majority (over 80%) of the value.
    - People often focus on winning points, even those of little consequence, and respond positively to concessions, no matter how insignificant.
    - Early in negotiations, introduce a lengthy list of seemingly important but inherently unreasonable demands to create the impression of their significance.
    - Save these points for later stages, as concessions on unimportant issues can be exchanged for gains on truly vital ones.
    - Example: In a negotiation with a sole supplier for pricing on 100 components of a crucial product, only about 20 parts truly affect the cost. Hold off on conceding prices for the remaining 80 parts to maintain bargaining power.
2. Timing is Crucial:
    - Most negotiations experience a period of relative inactivity before becoming more intense as the deadline approaches.
    - Due to time pressure, a significant portion (80%) of concessions occur in the final phase (last 20%) of the negotiation.
    - Presenting demands too early may lead to inflexibility and potential breakdown of the negotiation.
    - Additional demands or issues arising in the final 20% of the allotted time tend to lead to greater flexibility from both parties.
    - Patience is a virtue in negotiations; impatience can hinder effective negotiation.

Remember, negotiating strategically by focusing on essential points and timing can significantly impact the outcome of a negotiation.

### How to secure a pay raise
80 percent of concessions will be made in the last 20 percent of negotiating time. If your appointment to ask for a long-overdue raise is scheduled for 9:00 a.m. and you know your supervisor has another appointment at 10:00, expect the critical moments to occur around 9:50. Pace yourself accordingly. Don’t make your request too early to permit a gracious compromise on your supervisor’ s part.

Time is not the limiting factor; our perception and utilization of it are crucial. The 80/20 Principle asserts that a small portion of our efforts yields the majority of results in both achievement and happiness, emphasizing the need to prioritize high-value activities and challenge conventional time management practices.

- Time is not the issue; it's how we perceive and use it.
- 80% of achievement comes from 20% of time; conversely, 80% of time yields only 20% of output.
- 80% of happiness is from 20% of life; 80% of time contributes only 20% of happiness.
- Most of our actions have low value.
- Certain time fragments hold more value than the rest.
- The 80/20 Principle challenges traditional time management.
- Current time use is irrational; we need to rethink our assumptions.
- Time isn't scarce; we underutilize it.
- By focusing on top activities, we can achieve more in less time.
- It's our use of time, not time itself, that's the problem.
- Action often displaces thought, leading to time wastage.
- Parkinson's law states work expands to fit allocated time.
