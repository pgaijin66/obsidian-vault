## Before

  

Compiled vs intrepreted language


C = Code -> machine code ( binary 1 & 0 ) -> Execute = Faster : Go, C/C++

I = Code -> Interpreter -> machine code -> Execute = Comparatively: PHP, Python, Java -> JIT ( Just In Time Compiler )

Statically vs Dynamically typed language
  

Statically typed = Type checking at compile time eg: Go


Dynamically typed = Type checking at dynamically time eg: Python


Strongly vs Weakly typed languag
  

Strongly typed = Type conversion between unrelated types does allow eg: Python, Go


Weakly typed = Type conversion between unrelated types implicity eg: Javascript



### What is Go ?

Go is a strongly and statically typed compiled programming language.

Go is opionated programming language, enforce standard best practices by default, this leave less room error or buggy code.


### Is Go OOP ?

Go looks like OOP, but it is not

  

Inheritance, Abstraction, Encapsulation, Polymorphism

  

### Not in Go

  

No class sub-class

  

No constructor and deconstructor

  

No try / catch paradigm

  

only one loop i.e `for` loop

  

### Go compared to other programming languages

  

#### Go vs Python

  

Statically typed vs dynamically typed

  

Compiled vs intrepreted

  

Builtin support for concurreny vs need to import extra pacage

  

#### Go vs C/C++

  

Circular dependency

  

Garbage collection to manage memory clean up

  

No pointer arithemetics

  

#### Go vs Java

  

Less code

  

Multiple return

  
  

### Why

  

All goodness, it was built by Rob pike, Ken thomson as next gen language to C/C++.
