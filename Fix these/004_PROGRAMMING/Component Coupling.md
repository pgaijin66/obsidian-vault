- [[Component Coupling]]
	- [[Acyclic dependency principle ( ADP)]]
		- Avoid cyclic dependency
			- Solution:
				- Weekly build
					- Friday integrate and build the system
				- [[Acyclic Dependencies Principle ( ADP )]]
					- Partition dev environment into reusable components
					- Each component tied to a developer, once work done, release it
					- Other team can choose if they want to adopt the change or not
					- Directed acyclic graph ( [[DAG]] )
					- Breaking cyclic dependency issue
						- Solutions 1: Apply DIP in [[SOLID]] ( Dependency Inversion Principle ), instead of direct dependency, introduce an abstraction by implementing an interface.
						- Solution 2: Create new component and move dependency. When cycle occurs, they must be broken somehow. Sometimes this mean creating new components, 
							- JITTERS
								- noise ( unwanted stuffs )
	- [[Stable dependencies principle SDP]] )
		- ( depend in the direction of stability ) 
		- Any components that is expected to be volatile should not be dependent on by a component that is difficult to change
		- A component with a lot of incoming dependencies is very stable because it requires a great deal of work to reconcile any changes with all the dependent component
		- [[Stable]]
			- lot of incoming dependency
		- [[Unstable]]
			- less or no incoming dependency
		- [[Stability metrics]]
			- count no of dependency
			- [[Fan-in]]: Incoming dependencies
				- identified the no of classes outside this component that depend on class within the component
			- [[Fan-out]]: Outgoing dependencies
				- identifies the number of classed inside this component that depend on classes outside the component
			- [[Instability]]: I = [ [[Fan-out]], ([[Fan-in]] + [[Fan-out]]) ] , [0, 0]
				- I = 0 indicates maximally stable component
				- I = 1 indicates maximally unstable component
		- [[SDP]] tells, I metrics of a component should be larger than I metrics of the components it depends on.
		- I metrics should decrease in the direction of dependency
		- In a [[Directed Acyclic Graph DAG]] unstable component should be at top, flexible at middle and stable at bottom.
	- [[Stable Abstraction Principle SAP]])
		- ( component should be as abstract as it is stable ) (
		- software that represents high level of architecture and policy decision should be put into stable component ( I = 0)
		- Software that contains changeable parts and is volatile should be put into unstable components ( I = 1)
		- Relationship between [[stability]] and [[abstractness]]
		- [[SAP]] also says that a stable component should be abstract so that its stability does not prevent it from being extended.
		- [[SAP]] also says that an unstable component should be concrete since it its instability allows the concrete code within it to be easily changed.
		- If a component is called table
			- It should consists of an interface and abstract class so that it can be extended
		- [[SDP]] + [[SAP]] adds to [[DIP]] which means dependencies runs in the direction of abstraction
		- Measuring [[abstractions]]
			- A metric is measure of abstractness of a component
			- Nc: no of class in a component
			- Na: no of abstract classes and interface in the component
			- A: [[Abstractness]]. A = Na + Nc
			- A range from 0 to 1. 
			- A = 0 means component has no abstract class at all
			- A = 1 means components contains nothing but abstract classes.
